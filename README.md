"physical mesh network" running on STM32 arm, because it sounded "fun to program"

What is a "Physical Mesh Network"?? Just like it sounds. Little computers that stick together in a network. 
I have dreamed of building this for a long time and the time to do it is now! (unitl I get bored)

this is just testing hardware, currently on a "bluepill" STM32F103 chip.

The code is running the latest libopencm3 (as of 11/27/24) and uses the "easy" template found here 
 
https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-template.git 

I will add examples using the STM32 HAL as I get more into it. 

Perhaps even a "bare-metal" version if I am really motivated.
